** Changes in Colorado's Educational Attainment 2010 to 2019 **

A brief analysis of educational attainment among Colorado residents age 25 and older shows:

- Between 2010 and 2019, the percentage of Colorado residents with at least a Bachelor's Degree increased by approximately forty percent, compared to approximately 18 percent for the United States.  
Within this increase, the educational attainment of persons identifying as Hispanic and Other Persons of 
Color effectively doubled.  

 - The majority of Colorado's adult population was born in another state.  In 2019, half of these residents 
held at least a Bachelor's Degree, compared to about 33 percent of Coloradans, which is higher than the 
U.S. average of 40 percent for those born in another state and 28 percent for those born in Colorado.  
Among persons identifying as Hispanic, 28.7 percent of persons born in another state held at least a 
Bachelor's Degree, compared to 15.9 percent of native Coloradans.  

- Between 2010 and 2019 the percentage of native Coloradans with at least a Bachelor's Degree increased 
from 27 to almost 33 percent.  Among persons born in another state, this percentage increased from 44 
to 50 percent.  For persons born in another county, the percentage increased from 25 to 34 percent.  
This indicates that the rate of growth of the percentage of the population with at least a Bachelor's 
Degree does not vary substantially across migration groups.  

- In 2019, 21.8 percent of Colorado's population and 17.9 percent of Colorado's population over Age 25 
identified as Hispanic.  Among these adults, 18.5 percent held at least a Bachelor's Degree.  Among the 
U.S. States, the median percentage of persons identifying as Hispanic with at least a Bachelor's Degree is 
17.5 percent.  Colorado ranks 23rd in the nation in terms of educational attainment among persons 
identifying as Hispanic.  While Colorado ranks high in the proportion of the population identifying as 
Hispanic, the educational attainment of Colorado Hispanics is about average relative to other states.
