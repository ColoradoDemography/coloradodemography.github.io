Chinaâ€™s emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.
Simultaneously, it has challenged much of the received empirical wisdom about how labor markets
adjust to trade shocks. Alongside the heralded consumer benefits of expanded trade are substantial
adjustment costs and distributional consequences. These impacts are most visible in the local labor
markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated. Adjustment in local
labor markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed
and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences.
Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income. At the national level,
employment has fallen in U.S. industries more exposed to import competition, as expected, but offsetting
employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize. Better understanding when and where
trade is costly, and how and why it may be beneficial, are key items on the research agenda for trade
and labor economists.
