Between 2000 and 2007, Colorado and the US experienced a steep decline in fertility, both during and following the recession. But although the fertility rate is still declining, it’s declining at a slower rate. In part 1 of this series we looked at recent changes in fertility rates across our state by race and ethnicity, by age, and by region. Now let’s take a closer look at what we expect the future to bring, and what it means for Colorado.

**Up, Down or Steady?**

As mentioned in the first part of our series, Colorado reached a peak in the number of births in 2007 with 70,800. This was followed by a decline through the recession, bottoming out at 65,100 in 2012. Births have since climbed back to 66,600 in 2015. 

Looking ahead, the State Demography Office forecasts the number of births in Colorado will continue to climb slowly and will exceed the 2007 level of births just before the year 2023. At the same time, as younger women complete their transition to much lower fertility rates, total fertility will continue to decline through 2025. After 2025 total fertility is expected to increase slightly due to the increased share of population within older childbearing years and an increase in diversity within females of childbearing age.
