# 2016 Residential Construction Survey

 The Colorado Department of Local Affairs is beginning its process for calculating the July 1, 2016 population estimates that are used in the Conservation Trust Fund (CTF) program. The first phase of this process involves estimates of total housing units and group quarters facilities (such as prisons and dorms). These data will be used as the foundation for your entity's population estimate. 

This year we are asking that you reply to us with your total number of housing units for July 1, 2016.  If we do not receive data we will assume that the special district had no new housing units.


## Due Date: April 7th, 2017

This will be the only time during the estimates process that you will be able to update your residential construction, annexation or group quarters data for the July 2016 Population Estimates.
