## 2014 Residential Construction and Group Quarters Facility Survey

Dear Conservation Trust Fund Officer,

The Colorado Department of Local Affairs is beginning its process for calculating the July 1, 2014 population estimates that are used in the Conservation Trust Fund (CTF) program. The first phase of this process involves estimates of total housing units and group quarters facilities (such as prisons and dorms). These data will be used as the foundation for your entity's population estimate.

This year we will continue to use the online system to submit residence construction survey via the Local Government E-Filing Portal.  You will get your unique User ID via an email from our office.  If you have not received an email, please contact us (see below).

**Special Districts should use the spreadsheet under Table 3 (below) and send to spreadsheet to [robert.kemp@colorado.edu ![email](/images/email_link.png 'send email')](mailto:robert.kemp@colorado.edu) rather than using the online tool.**

Please go to the [DLG E-Filing Portal](https://dola.colorado.gov/dlg_efiling/). After you agree to the term of use, then you will get to the login page. Users will get a password by clicking the "First time user or forgot your password?" link and enter the user ID you have received on the password reset screen.  The password will be sent to your email.  Then you will be able to login to the system using your new password.

Once logged in, you will start at a “contact” page.  If the information is correct, click on “continue without changes” or make and “save changes”.  On the next page you can see a summary of data submitted for previous years or click on the “Residential Construction Survey” tab where you will be able to submit building permits, certificates of occupancy and demolitions. Click on the Blue” Add Survey” and you will be prompted to select a geography and type of residential data and year.   **If you have submitted data in previous years, you do not need to submit again for those years, unless there are changes.**  We are primarily interested in building permits from 2013 or certificates of occupancy from July 2013 through June 2014 but will take the most current data you have as well as any changes or new data back to 2010.

Please view the [Residential Construction Survey E-Filing Portal Instruction Sheet ![pdf](/images/page_white_acrobat.png 'download pdf file')](http://dola.colorado.gov/demog-cms/sites/dola.colorado.gov.demog-cms/files/demog-docs/rcs/RCS%20EFiling%20Instructions%20v2014.pdf) or the [Residential Construction Survey E-Filing Portal Instruction Webinar ![external link](/images/link.png 'external link')](http://codeptofla.adobeconnect.com/p65xvnzvwdp/) for instructions and more information.

**Please contact us by phone or email if you have any changes in housing units or group quarters due to annexations.**

The tables below contain your area’s previous years’ housing unit and group quarters facility data for reference and review.

We need you to review these data and provide any documented 2013-14 input data by **January 7, 2015** for the July 2014 Conservation Trust Fund estimates process. This will be the only time during the estimates process that you will be able to update your residential construction, annexation or group quarters data for the July 2014 Population Estimates.

Please send all data and questions to Rob Kemp, Estimates Demographer, at [robert.kemp@state.co.us ![email](/images/email_link.png 'send email')](mailto:robert.kemp@colorado.edu), (303) 864-7755.  Please submit all data using the guidelines on this page.

**Table A: 2010-2013 Residential Construction Data from Local Governments** 

These tables are grouped by county. Please evaluate the number of housing units for your entity for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 then go to the [DLG E-Filing Portal](https://dola.colorado.gov/dlg_efiling/) to send us any updates for previous years and 2014.

**Table 2: 2010 Census to 2013 Estimates of Population and Households by County and Municipality** 

These tables are grouped by county. Please evaluate the number of housing units for your entity and please go to the [DLG E-Filing Portal](https://dola.colorado.gov/dlg_efiling/) to send us any updates on residential contruction data. If you are a place that resides in multiple counties, you can review your total data in the "Multi County Places" file for the total and the county-specific files for the parts in each County. You will need to enter data for each part rather than the total if your place is in multiple counties.
