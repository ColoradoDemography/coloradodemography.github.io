# Draft 2014 CTF Population Estimates

[Letter to Local Governments ![pdf](/images/page_white_acrobat.png 'download pdf file')](https://dola.colorado.gov/demog-cms/sites/dola.colorado.gov.demog-cms/files/demog-docs/ctf_draft/CTFDraftLetter_2014_CaC_draft.pdf)

The Colorado Department of Local Affairs, State Demography Office (SDO) has prepared draft July 1, 2014 population estimates for your review. These population estimates, once finalized, will be the basis for the distribution of Conservation Trust Fund (CTF) lottery funds to your jurisdiction.

The July 1, 2014 estimates are based on the April 1st, 2010 census plus annual data on births, deaths, net migration, change in group quarters facilities and housing unit change.  The estimates for the previous year  will be different than the one released because of the updated census migration estimate data.

Counties and municipalities should review Table 2 in particular (Municipalities in Multiple Counties should look at the “Multi-County” file to see their total estimates).

Local governments are provided thirty (30) days in which they can review and challenge the population estimate for their entity. In order to file a challenge, you must send a letter to **Tamra Norton, Conservation Trust Fund Administrator, 1313 Sherman St., Room 521, Denver, CO 80203** or [tamra.hooper@state.co.us ![email](/images/email_link.png 'send email')](mailto:tamra.hooper@state.co.us), no later than July 1, 2015. The letter should indicate your concern about the estimate, describe the basis of your concern with supporting data, if possible, and the name of a contact person that staff can work with to resolve any differences.

Please send questions to Rob Kemp at 303-864-7755, [robert.kemp@state.co.us ![email](/images/email_link.png 'send email')](mailto:robert.kemp@state.co.us).  

Local government input and involvement in our estimates process ensures the most accurate data for Conservation Trust Fund distribution. 

Thank you for your assistance and cooperation.
