#### Race and Ethnicity

Race and ethnicity in the US Census are self-identification data items in which residents choose the race or races with which they most closely identify, and indicate whether or not they are of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

Race and ethnicity are considered separate and distinct identities, with Hispanic or Latino origin asked as a separate questions. Thus, in addition to their race or races, all respondents are categorized by membership in one of two ethnicities, which are "Hispanic or Latino" and "Not Hispanic or Latino."
