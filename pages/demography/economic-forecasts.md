## Economic Forecasts

---

#### Forecasting Worksheets

One-page worksheets which summarize the jobs, labor force and population forecasts for each planning and management region, county and Colorado as a whole. They include information on basic jobs, indirect and induced jobs, total jobs, multiple job holding rates, commuting, unemployment, labor force participation, and population.

In the spreadsheets the region total is listed first followed by the counties within the region. However, for the counties in Region 3 only Gilpin and Clear Creek are listed separately. The rest are combined for a Metro Denver total. For questions please contact Chris Akers at 303-866-7751 or [chris.akers@state.co.us](mailto:chris.akers@state.co.us).
