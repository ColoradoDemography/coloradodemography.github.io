<h3>Census Field Operations in Colorado Resume on May 18, 2020</h3>
<p style="text-align:center">2020 Census Field Operations Resume in Colorado</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Census workers to wear PPE</p>

<p><b>Denver, CO</b> -  The U.S. Census Bureau is resuming 2020 Census field operations in Colorado next week. For the health and safety of Census employees and the public, field staff will observe social distancing protocols and will wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
U.S. Census Bureau field employees will begin dropping off 2020 Census invitation packets at front doors of households in areas that do not receive mail at their homes. 
This field operation follows current federal health and safety guidelines and does not require interaction between households and Census Bureau employees.</p>
<p>Households that receive the 2020 Census invitation packets are strongly encouraged to respond promptly - using the census ID included in the questionnaire packet. 
Coloradans can still respond <a href="https://2020census.gov/" target="_blank">online</a>, by 
<a href="https://2020census.gov/en/ways-to-respond/responding-by-phone.html" target="_blank">phone</a> or by completing and returning the paper form by mail. 
Responding online with the Census ID or completing and returning the paper questionnaire helps ensure an accurate count of Colorado communities.</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/press-kits/2020/acos-reopen.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a> for updates on field operations by location. This webpage will be updated weekly as field operations resume in phases across the United States. </p>
<p>Later this year, the U.S. Census Bureau plans to send census takers to visit Colorado households that have not responded to the 2020 Census to help them complete questionnaires.</p>
