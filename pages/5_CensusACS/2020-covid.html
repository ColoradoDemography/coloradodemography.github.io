<li>Click on <a href="https://2020census.gov/en/news-events/operational-adjustments-covid-19.html" target="_blank">2020 Census Operational Updates</a> page for the latest information.</li>
 <li>The timing of Census Programs is subject to change as COVID-19 health conditions change</li>
</ul>
<p>Census Bureau is pausing several of their field operations until the end of March (depending on conditions) to help protect 
the health and safety of the public as well as Census Bureau Employees. <i>See the "Key Dates" section on the "Tools for Communities" page for the updated schedule.</i></p> 
<ul>
<li>Invitations letters have been mailed to all mail delivery houses.  Second mailings have already started.</li>
<li>Hand delivery of census packets to 10% of Colorado housing units that don’t receive mail will be delayed until the end of March.  
Even if you have not received your packet, you can still go online to respond at <a href="https://2020census.gov/" target="_blank">2020census.gov</a> and use the physical address of your house to log in – not a PO Box.</li>
<li>Counting College Students</li>
<ul>
<li>Students normally staying in dorms should still be counted at the dorm in a collaborative effort between the college or university and Census Bureau.</li>
<li>Students living off campus should be counted at their off campus housing using the address of the housing (if the student does not have the invitation letter).</li>
<li>It is ok, but not essential, to include students on parent’s household form but also mark that they typically live somewhere else.</li>
</ul>
<li>Workers laid off from ski areas or other tourism areas should be counted in those locations if that is where they usually live - even if they are not living there now due to COVID-19.</li>
<li>The Census count of prople experiencing homelessness has been delayed from March 30th - April 1 until April 30th - May 1st.</li>
<li>The Census count of Group Quarters locations (like nursing homes, prisons, and student dorms) is being delayed until mid April.  
  The Census Bureau is encouraging administrators of facilities to choose an option for counting their residents that requires less in-person contact.</li>
<li>Keep your communities informed.  Push social media and other electronic communications with your networks to encourage online self-response as the 
   safest way to respond to the Census..
