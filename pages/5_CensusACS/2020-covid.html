<h4>Counting College Students</h4>
<ul>
<li>Students normally staying in dorms should still be counted at the dorm in a collaborative effort between the college or university and Census Bureau.</li>
<li>Students living off campus should be counted at their off campus housing using the address of their housing unit (if the student does not have the invitation letter).</li>
<li>It is ok, but not essential, to include students on parent’s household form but also mark that they typically live somewhere else.</li>
