## Census 2020 Facts and FAQ

### It’s Important

* The 2020 Census counts are used to determine the representation of Colorado in the U.S. House of Representatives.  The distribution of congressional representatives impacts your voice in Congress.
* The Census affects funding in your community and will provide important information for community to use over the next decade.
* Census data affects the distribution of federal funds to your community.  It is estimated that over 8 billion dollars (which translates to $1,480 per person) are allocated to Colorado annually based on Decennial Census statistics.  Federal, state and local governments, businesses, nonprofits and foundations, routinely rely on data from the Census to allocate funding, define where services are delivered, and promote economic development. An accurate census count is essential for our state.

### It’s Easy

* The Census is easy to answer.  You can complete the census online, over the phone, or by filling out a paper form.  It will ask for the name, address, sex, age, race, ethnicity, relationship and housing tenure for every person living in your household on April 1, 2020. 

### It’s Safe

* The privacy of your responses is guaranteed by law.  The Census form does not ask for your Social Security number, your income or financial assets.  Name and addressed are asked only to insure that each person in the United States is counted once where they live.  
* Census workers are sworn to secrecy. They know that if they give out any information, they can face a $250,000 fine and jail time.
* By law, the Census Bureau cannot share individual respondent answers with the FBI, the CIA, Welfare Immigration or even the President of the United States.

### It’s Required

Article I, Section 2 of the US Constitution mandates that all persons living in the United States be counted every 10 years.  The Census Bureau must count everyone and submit state population totals to the US President by December 31 of each census year.  Responding to the Census is also required by Title 13 of the United States Code, the same law that guarantees the privacy of your responses.


## FAQs

**Q: Why is the Census Bureau conducting a Census?**<br>
A: The U.S. Constitution requires a full count of the population every ten years.  The goal of the 2020 Census is to count everyone once, only once, and in the right place.  This information is used to determine the number of Congressional representatives given to each state (as outlined in the U.S. Constitution), to determine the allocation of federal dollars to states, cities and counties, and to help citizen and policy makers understand demographic, economic, and geographic trends required to inform critical business and planning  decisions. 

**Q: How can I respond to the Census?**<br>
A: In 2020 you can respond to the census on-line (using a computer or a smartphone), over the telephone, or by submitting a paper form.  Early in 2020 all Census addresses will receive a card inviting the residents to complete the Census.  The 2020 Census card will provide people with a URL so they can complete the census online, a toll-free telephone number if they want to call in their responses, and an address to request a paper form.  

**Q: Who should be counted?**<br>
A: All residents living at an address as of April 1, 2020 should be counted.  This includes young children (ages from birth to 5 years old), older children living at an address, grandparents, family members and other, non-relatives living at the address.

**Q: What about college students? What about people in other places?**<br>
A: College students living in a dormitory on April 1, 2020 will be counted at their dormitory.  People living in prisons, people living in shelters, people in the military, or people living in other group quarters will be counted where they live.

**Q: Will the Census form be available in multiple languages?**<br>
A: Yes.  The on-line and paper versions of the census form will be available in multiple languages.  

**Q: Do I have to enter a Census ID number?**<br>
A: No.  The census form will ask you for your address and use that information to verify your location and ensure that no one else has completed your census form.

**Q: Will a census worker come to my door?**<br>
A: In most cases, no.  The Census Bureau will send out multiple notices encouraging people to respond.  Some of these mailings will include the census form.  Census workers will only visit those addresses that did not respond to these mailings.  

**Q: How will I know that someone is from the Census?**<br>
A: All Census workers carry official government badges marked with their name.  You can ask them for a picture ID from another source to confirm their identity.  If you are still are not certain about their identity, please call the Regional Census Center toll-free number (1-800-852-6159) to confirm they are employed by the Census Bureau.

**Q: What data is reported?**<br>
A: The Census Bureau reports aggregate data, i.e., information about the people living in a defined area, not individual data.  The privacy of your responses is guaranteed by law.  The form does not ask for your Social Security number, your income or financial assets.  Name and addressed are asked only to insure that each person in the US is counted once where they live.  

**Q: Will my individual responses be reported to another government agency?**<br>
A: No.  By law, Title 13 prohibits the Census Bureau from sharing individual respondent answers with the FBI, the CIA, Welfare, Immigration or even the President of the United States.  

**Q: What if I choose not to answer a question?  Will the Census Bureau follow up?**<br>
A: The accuracy of the census depends on everyone providing accurate answers to all of the questions on the Census form.  However, if you decide not to answer a question the Census Bureau will not follow up with you.  The Census Bureau is planning to follow up with addresses that have not returned a form, but there are no plans to re-contact people who leave a question blank.

**Q: What if I have questions later?**<br>
A: If you have additional questions, please call the Regional Census Center  at *1-800-852-6159* (toll-free) or visit [https://www.census.gov/about/regions/denver.html](https://www.census.gov/about/regions/denver.html)
