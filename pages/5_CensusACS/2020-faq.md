## Census 2020 Frequently Asked Questions

Updated 4/19/2019

**Q: What is the Census?**

A: The Census is a head count of everyone residing in the United States on April 1, 2020.  It has been mandated by the U.S. Constitution (Article 1, Section 2) since 1790 and it occurs every 10 years.  The Census counts people of all ages, race, and ethnic groups. Population totals from the decennial Census determine the number of seats each state has in the House of Representatives; the totals are also used to redraw federal and state legislative districts. The Census population counts are used to determine the allocation of federal dollars to states, cities and counties, and to help citizens and policy makers understand demographic, economic, and geographic trends needed to inform critical business decisions.

**Q: When is Census 2020?**

A: Census Day is April 1, 2020 but the online tool will start accepting responses in mid-March.  Some other programs will be starting in March as well.

**Q: How can I respond to the Census?**

A: In 2020 you can respond to the census on-line (using a computer or a smart phone), over the telephone, or by submitting a paper form.  Early in 2020 all census addresses will receive a card inviting the residents to complete the census.  The 2020 Census provide people with a URL so they can complete the census online, a toll-free telephone number if they want to call in their responses, and an address to request a paper form.

**Q:  What questions are asked on the Census?**

A: The census form asks 11 questions about each person in a household:

1. Name
2. Phone Number
3. Age
4. Sex
5. Citizenship 
6. Hispanic Origin
7. Race
8. Relationship to Householder 
9. Household Tenure/Ownership
10. Number of Persons in Household
11. Additional Residence Location
 
The Census Bureau estimates that it will take ten minutes per person in a household to complete the census form.

**Q: What does the citizenship question ask?**

A: The proposed citizenship question asks whether a person was born in the United States or its Territories, whether a person was born overseas to U.S. Citizen parents,  whether a person is a naturalized citizen, or whether a person is not a citizen.   It does not ask about a person's legal status.

- You can find a fact sheet describing the citizenship question on the  [Census 2020 Fact Sheets page.](https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/census-acs/2020-factsheets/)

**Q. What is the status of the citizenship question?**

A:  Several states (including Colorado) have challenged the inclusion of the citizenship question on the current census form.  Courts in New York, California and Maryland have rejected this question on administrative grounds.  The United States Department of Justice has appealed these decisions. This matter will be heard before the United States Supreme Court in April 2020.  The Supreme Court must rule on this issue by June 2020 to insure that census materials are printed in time. At this point, we are assuming that the citizenship question will be included on the 2020 census form.

- You can follow the progress of this case on the [Census 2020 News page.](https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/census-acs/2020-news/).

**Q: How can I tell if a census mailing is authentic?**

A: The initial mailings for the 2020 Census will begin in March, 2020. However, the Census Bureua conducts multiple surveys every year.  To confirm the authenticity of a census mailing, please check the links below:

- [Are you In a Survey?](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/are-you-in-a-survey/survey-list.html)

**Q: Will a census worker come to my door?**

A: In most cases, no.  The Census Bureau will send out multiple notices encouraging people to respond.  Some of these mailings will include the census form.  Census workers will only visit those addresses that did not respond to a previous mailing. 

**Q: How will I know that someone is from the Census Bureau?**

A: All census workers carry official government badges marked with their name.  You can ask them for a picture ID from another source to confirm their identity.  If you are still not certain about an enumeratorâ€™s identity, you can call the Census Regional Census Center at *1-800-852-6159* (toll-free) to confirm that an individual is employed by the Census Bureau.

**Q: Who should be counted?**

A: All residents living at an address as of April 1, 2020 should be counted.  This includes family members, all children born on or before April 1, 2020,  grandparents, and other, non-related persons living at an address.

**Q: What about college students? What about people in other places?**

A: College students living in a dormitory on April 1, 2020 will be counted at their dormitory.  People living in prisons, people living in shelters, people in the military, or people living in other group quarters will be counted where they live.  College students living in off campus housing should be counted at the off campus housing if that is where they living most of the time.

**Q: Will the census form be available in multiple languages?**

A: Yes.  The on-line version of the census form will be available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Russian, Arabic,
Tagalog, Polish, French, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and Japanese.  The Census Bureau will provide video and print language guides, language glossaries, and language identification cards in  a total of 59 non-English languages.  The selection of languages is based on an analysis of "Limited-English Speaking Households" from the 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-year estimates.

- See the Census Bureau's "2020 Census Non-English Language Support" memo [here.](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/program-management/memo-series/2020-memo-2018_06.pdf)


**Q: Do I have to enter a census ID number?**

A: The census invitation card will contain a census ID number linked to the address of your housing unit.  The census form will ask you to enter the census ID number or your address.  You can enter either to verify your location and ensure that no one else has completed your census form.

**Q: Are my census responses private?**

A: Yes.  Federal law prohibits the Census Bureau from using the information it collects for anything but statistical purposes.  The Census Bureau releases aggregated data, i.e., information about the people living in a defined area, not individual person level data.  The privacy of your responses is guaranteed by law.  The form does not ask for your Social Security number, bank account information or financial assets.  Name and address are asked only to insure that each person is counted once where they live.  

**Q: Will my individual responses be reported to another government agency?**

A: No.  By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondent answers with the FBI, the CIA, ICE or even the Present of the United States.

**Q: What if I choose not to answer a question?  Will the Census Bureau follow up?**

A: The accuracy of the census depends on everyone providing accurate answers to all of the questions on the census form.  If you decide not to answer a question the Census Bureau may follow up with you as part of its quality control process.  The Census Bureau's Nonresponse Follow Up program (NRFU) will send a census enumerator out to addresses that have not submitted a census form, but there are no plans to contact all addresses that skip questions.

**Q: When will the Census counts be released?**

A: Counts for reapportionment must be delivered to the President of the United States by December 31, 2020.  Counts will be released to the states for redistricting purposes by April 1, 2021.  More detailed counts will be released beginning in 2022.


**Q: What resources is the State of Colorado committing to the Census?**

A: Data collection and management of the census is a federal responsibility.  The State of Colorado's role in the census is updating and verifying address information and promoting the census.  In Fiscal Year 2020, the Colorado State Demography Office will have funds to provide promotional materials describing the census to communities and other organizations.  Please contact us [here](mailto:adam.bickford@state.co.us)  if you have any questions about these materials.

**Q: What if I have questions later?**

A: If you have additional questions, please call the Regional Census Center at *1-800-852-6159* (toll-free) or visit [https://www.census.gov/about/regions/denver.html](https://www.census.gov/about/regions/denver.html)
