#### Colorado and the 2010 Census

The administration of the decennial Census is a federal activity mandated by the constitution. In order for our communities to ensure they are completely and accurately counted in April 2010, it must also be a partnership between the US Census Bureau and local governments.

We will maintain this website throughout the entire Census 2010 cycle (ending about 2013) **and will provide current, timely and accurate information relevant to the communities and residents of Colorado** as follow-up on the 2010 Census proceeds and we will also inform Colorado stakeholders about Census 2010 endeavors throughout the state.
