## Why Complete the Census?

### Everyone Counts in Colorado.  Show that you are here.

### It’s Important
* The 2020 Census counts are used for reapportionment - the process of re-distributing seats in the House of Representatives to each state based on Census counts. The distribution of congressional representatives impacts your voice in Congress.  It is estimated based on current trends that Colorado could gain an additional congressional seat.
*	Census 2020 counts are used for redistricting.  Redistricting draws boundaries within each state for voting and representation.  Redistricting occurs for the U.S. House of Representative districts, State House and Senate Districts, county commissioners, city council, and other local governments.
*	Census data affects the distribution of federal funds to your community.  It is estimated that  13.1 billion dollars (which translates to $2,300 per person) are allocated to Colorado annually based on decennial census statistics.  
*	An accurate Census count is essential for our state. The federal, state and local governments, businesses, nonprofits and foundations, routinely rely on data from the Census to allocate funding, define where services are delivered, promote economic development, and understand current conditions.

### It’s Easy 
*	The Census is easy to answer.  You can complete the census online, using your smartphone, over the phone, or by filling out a paper form.  It will ask for your name, address, sex, age, race, ethnicity, relationship and housing tenure. 

### It’s Safe
*	The privacy of your responses is guaranteed by law.  The form does not ask for your Social Security number or other personal identifiers.  Name and address are asked only to ensure that each person in the US is counted only once where they live.  
*	Census workers are sworn to secrecy. They know that if they give out any information, they can face a $250,000 fine and jail time.
*	By law, the Census Bureau cannot share respondent answers with the FBI, the CIA, Welfare, Immigration or even the President of the United States.

### It’s Required
*	Article I, Section 2 of the US Constitution mandates the count of all persons living in the US every 10 years.  The Census Bureau must count everyone and submit state population totals to the US President by December 31 of each census year.  Responding to the Census is also required by Title 13 of the United States Code, the same law that guarantees the privacy of your responses.
