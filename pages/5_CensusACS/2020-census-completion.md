There are many reasons to complete and submit your 2020 Census form. The Census gives us an opportunity to show that we are here. There other reasons, political reasons dealing with representation of Colorado in the Congress, the representation of your community in the Colorado General Assembly, and financial reasons dealing with the distribution of federal and state funds. But these are not the most important reasons to complete and submit your Census form.
  
Colorado is a diverse and vibrant state, and its people are unique. No matter if you live on the Eastern Plains, the Western Slope, the San Luis Valley or on the Front Range, each person adds to strength and resilience of the Colorado way of life. The Census is an opportunity to state positively that we all are here and that we all contribute to the Colorado we love.

Consider what could happen if you don’t submit your Census form. Census data is used to establish a profile of the state population that will be used for the next ten years. If the 2020 profile is inaccurate, if it doesn’t reflect the people who are actually living in Colorado, decisions will be made based on this inaccurate information until 2030. Entire communities could be ignored, their needs unaddressed, for the next decade. Census data is used to inform many decisions, decisions that will impact your community. Good, equitable decisions depend on accurate data.  The accuracy of the Census depends on your participation.
