## Detailed Census Operational Plans

The Census Bureau published detailed plans documenting all of its operations. The Operational Plans cover multiple subjects including plans for Service Based Enumeration (which will produce counts for people exteriencing homelessness), the Non-Response Follow-Up process (the process of enumerating households that do not respond to the census voluntarily), and many other topics.  The collection of operational plans can be accessed here:

### Census Barriers, Attitudes, and Motivators Study (CBAMS)

The Census Barriers, Attitudes and Motivators Study (CBAMS) reports Census Bureau research into the barriers and motivational issues that can impact census responses.  The CBAMS study combines a series of focus groups and a sample survey. 

* The focus groups component of the 2020 CBAMS will provide deeper and more specific insights than can be obtained through the survey, especially for hard-to-count populations. A particular emphasis of the focus groups is on areas that may be underrepresented in the survey, such as households in rural areas; young, single, mobile individuals; and no or low internet proficiency. Included hard-to-count racial and ethnic minorities include American Indian and Alaska Natives (AIAN), Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI), and Middle Eastern and North African (MENA). Historically, these groups all have among the lowest propensities to respond to the decennial census. Focus groups will ensure we have sufficient and actionable research to guide outreach to these groups. There were 42 total focus groups that took place in 14 locations across the county from March 14 through April 19, 2018.

* The 2020 CBAMS Survey, publicly called the 2020 Census Planning Survey, is a nationwide survey of 50,000 households that covers a range of topics related to census participation and completion. Results will allow the Census Bureau to understand and compare barriers, attitudes, and motivators across demographic subgroups such as Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, and, given sufficient sample size, additional groups like income and education levels. The survey period was February 20 through April 17, 2018; respondents were able to complete the survey in English or Spanish either online or by mailing back the questionnaire.

Official invitations will be mailed starting April 2019.  Changes from 2010 include participation by the States and inclusion of Group Quarters and Transitory Locations.


Please be aware that the program is offered and limited to those specific areas and governments where we are using the U.S. Postal Service to deliver* an enumeration package to the housing unit.  This specific location information will be shared with participants once they register for the program.  As before, this program does NOT require a Title-13 confidentiality agreement.


*For those governments and areas not covered by postal delivery, the Census Bureau will be documenting newly constructed housing units during our Update/Leave field operation.
