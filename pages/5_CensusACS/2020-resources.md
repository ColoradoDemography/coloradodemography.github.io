**Census New Construction Program**

Access the U.S. Census New Construction Program Flyer [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=150NAdBhsWChmsYvcVtvJDodcMfqyt1kp) . 

Official invitations will be mailed starting April 2019.  Changes from 2010 include participation by the States and inclusion of Group Quarters and Transitory Locations.


Please be aware that the program is offered and limited to those specific areas and governments where we are using the U.S. Postal Service to deliver* an enumeration package to the housing unit.  This specific location information will be shared with participants once they register for the program.  As before, this program does NOT require a Title-13 confidentiality agreement.


*For those governments and areas not covered by postal delivery, the Census Bureau will be documenting newly constructed housing units during our Update/Leave field operation.
