## Census Type of Enumeraton Area Viewer (TEA)
 
 The *Census Type of Enumeration Area Viewer (TEA)* shows census tracts that will receive census forms through the "Update/Leave" and "Update/Enumerate" programs. These programs are designed to serve rural areas with homes that do not have standard street addresses. The census bureau estimates that five percent of  homes nationwide will be enumerated using these programs. 
 
- Homes that are part of the "Update/Leave" program will be visited by a census enumerator, who will leave a census form behind for the household to complete. 
- Homes that are part of the "Update/Enumerate" program will be visited by an enumerator, who will complete the census form during their visit with a household.  The "Update/Enumerate" program is focused on remote areas in Alaska and Northern Maine.

## Census Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM) and other resources to identify Hard to Count Populations
 
### Colorado Counties and Census Tracts Identifier Map

The *Colorado Counties and Census Tracts Identifier Map* is a tool produced by SDO to identify population characterists of Colorado counties and census tracts.

###  Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM)

 The *Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM)* is a tool developed by the U.S. Census Bureau to identify hard-to-survey areas.

### Census Planning Database
 
The Census Planning Database (PDB) assembles a range of housing, demographic, socioeconomic, and census operational data that can be used for survey and census planning. Data are provided at both the census block group and tract levels of geography.  It includes the Census *Low Response Score (LRS)* used to identify tracts with a high number of "hard to count" populations.

### Modelling the Low Response Score  
This paper describes how the Low Response Score (LRS) is calculated and identifies population characteristics associated with high LRS percentages.

 ## Census 2020 Response Tracker<br>
 
 This page will host the *Census 2020 Response Tracker.*
 
 Beginning in April 2020, communities can use this page to track the number of census forms returned.  
 Information about census form returns and response rate goals will be available in an interactive format.
