## Census Mail Contact Strategies Viewer

The U.S. Census Bureau today released the **Mail Contact Strategies Viewer** showing how the country will be asked to respond to the 2020 Census. Nearly every household will be invited to respond online, by phone or by mail to the census starting in mid-March 2020. Most areas—about three of every four households—will receive an invitation to respond online (or by phone), while the other households will receive a paper questionnaire along with an invitation to respond online. Regardless of which invitation they receive, all households that have not yet responded will receive a paper questionnaire by mid-April. This map also shows which households will receive English/Spanish bilingual invitations and questionnaires.

The interactive map illustrates the contact strategy to inform the public and partners of the Census Bureau’s plan to count everyone by geographic location for the 2020 Census. A decade of research and testing has determined the best way to invite everyone to respond to the 2020 Census.

Most households will first receive a letter asking them to complete the census questionnaire online with information about how to respond online or by phone in English plus 12 non-English languages. Areas less likely to respond online, approximately 21.8% of households, will receive a paper questionnaire along with the invitation to respond online or over the phone. Areas assigned to receive a paper questionnaire first have a low self-response rate to the Census Bureau’s ongoing American Community Survey (ACS), and have either low internet response rates, high population over age 65, or low rate of internet subscriptions.

## Census Type of Enumeraton Area Viewer (TEA)
 
 The *Census Type of Enumeration Area Viewer (TEA)* shows census tracts that will receive census forms through the "Update/Leave" and "Update/Enumerate" programs. These programs are designed to serve rural areas with homes that do not have standard street addresses. The census bureau estimates that five percent of  homes nationwide will be enumerated using these programs. 
 
- Homes that are part of the "Update/Leave" program will be visited by a census enumerator, who will leave a census form behind for the household to complete. 
- Homes that are part of the "Update/Enumerate" program will be visited by an enumerator, who will complete the census form during their visit with a household.  The "Update/Enumerate" program is focused on remote areas in Alaska and Northern Maine.

## Census Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM) and other resources to identify Hard to Count Populations
 
### Colorado Counties and Census Tracts Identifier Map

The *Colorado Counties and Census Tracts Identifier Map* is a tool produced by SDO to identify population characterists of Colorado counties and census tracts.

###  Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM)

 The *Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM)* is a tool developed by the U.S. Census Bureau to identify hard-to-survey areas.

### Census Planning Database
 
The Census Planning Database (PDB) assembles a range of housing, demographic, socioeconomic, and census operational data that can be used for survey and census planning. Data are provided at both the census block group and tract levels of geography.  It includes the Census *Low Response Score (LRS)* used to identify tracts with a high number of "hard to count" populations.

### Modelling the Low Response Score  
This paper describes how the Low Response Score (LRS) is calculated and identifies population characteristics associated with high LRS percentages.
