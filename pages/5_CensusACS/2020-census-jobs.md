## Census 2020 Jobs

Last Updated: 12/19/2019

## Census work will not impact your SNAP and TANF benefits

Working as a Census Enumerator will not impact your benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF).

Wages from part-time employmwent by the Census Bureau are considered "short-term" employment.  Colorado has received waivers from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of health and Human Services (HHS) that exempt Census wages from SNAP and TANF eligibility calculations.

See the executive order exempting Census employment from [SNAP and TANF benefit calculations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/M-18-26.pdf).
