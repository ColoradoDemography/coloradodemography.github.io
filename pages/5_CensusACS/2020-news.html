Critics of the citizenship question inclusion fear that this question, combined with the already volatile debate around immigration will lead to respondent&apos;s apathy, as undocumented respondents will face three options; either tell the truth, lie about their status or opt out of answering it, which means that two-thirds of the potential outcomes indicate tampering with the data.
<br>
However, this is not a matter that exclusively concerns the estimated 12 million undocumented residents in this country. Even documented immigrants like green card holders and naturalized citizens are expressing concerns with how the data gathered by the Census could be used as residents may be losing faith in government officials and may be afraid of answering the questionnaire altogether.

The U.S. Census Bureau has stopped plans to form a new committee of advisers for the upcoming 2020 census, according to a letter obtained by NPR.

The decision comes as the agency prepares for the once-a-decade head count of every person living in the country while battling multiple lawsuits over a new citizenship question and cybersecurity concerns about the first U.S. census to be conducted online. Similar advisory committees were put in place before the national head counts in 2000 and 2010.

If there&apos;s going to be a fight over President Donald Trump&apos;s choice for the next director of the U.S. Census Bureau, it won&apos;t be over whether Steven Dillingham has sufficient government experience: He&apos;s led two smaller federal statistical agencies and spent several more years at other agencies.
<br><br>
Instead, the fight will be over whether Dillingham, a 66-year-old native of South Carolina and rock-ribbed Republican, is capable of steering the agency through a sea of controversy as it prepares for the 2020 census. Democrats and civil rights groups worry he will do the bidding of his political bosses and undermine the integrity of the decennial head count. But those who know him, including liberal academics, say he&apos;s a straight shooter with good management skills and someone who doesn&apos;t let his conservative political views interfere with day-to-day operations.
