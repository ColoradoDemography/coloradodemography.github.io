#### Colorado and the 2020 Census

The administration of the decennial Census is a federal activity mandated by the constitution. In order for our communities to ensure they are completely and accurately counted in April 2020, it must also be a partnership between the US Census Bureau and local governments.

We will maintain this website throughout the entire Census 2020 cycle (ending about 2023) and will provide current, timely and accurate information relevant to the communities and residents of Colorado as follow-up on the 2020 Census proceedings and we will also inform Colorado stakeholders about Census 2020 endeavors throughout the state.
