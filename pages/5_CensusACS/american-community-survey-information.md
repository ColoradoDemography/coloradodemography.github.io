[Online Training Now Available!](/demography/training#training)

The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide, continuous survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely **demographic, housing, social, economic** and **financial** data every year. Information from the ACS helps determine how more than $400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed.

To help communities, state governments and federal programs, the US Census Bureau collects information on multiple characteristics including sex, race, income, health insurance, education and disabilities. All this detail is combined into statistics that are used to help decide everything from school lunch programs to new hospitals. You can [read more about the ACS on their website (census.gov)](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/).

The State Demography Office has compiled information to help data users understand and use this continuous stream of information. Please visit our [FAQ page](/census-acs/american-community-survey-frequently-asked-questions#american-community-survey---frequently-asked-questions) and check out our handy [user guide to understanding Margins of Error (MOE)](/demography/understanding-margins-error#understanding-margins-of-error).
