<h1>Census 2020 Data Tools</h1>
<p>This page features a veriety of data tools developed by the State Demography Office and the Census Bureau to assist with Census completion planning, track Census response rates,
 and understanding the characteristics of the hard to count population.</p>
<h2>State Demography Office Tools to identify Census Contact Areas, Hard to Count Communities, and Census Grant expenditures</h2>
<br>
<button class="accordion"><h2>Colorado Census Contact Type Map</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>This map, developed by the State Demography Office, idenifies the response types for Census tracts throughout the state.  
The map identifes areas where households will receive a Census invitation letter, a Census initation packet containing a paper Census form, or will be have a Census packet 
delivered by a Census enumerator.  All housholds will be able to respond to the Census online, via telephone, or by using a paper form.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h2>Colorado Counties and Census Tracts Identifier Map</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The <em>Colorado Counties and Census Tracts Identifier Map</em> is a tool produced by the State Demography Office to identify population characterists of Colorado counties and census tracts.
Information from this map can help idenrify hard to count populations.</p>

<h2>Census Bureau Tools to identify Census Contact Areas, Response Rates, Hard to Count Communities and the Census Planning Database</h2>
<br>
<button class="accordion"><h2>Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM)</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The Census <em>Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM)</em> is a tool developed by the U.S. Census Bureau to identify hard-to-survey areas.
After the beginning of Census Data collection, use this tool to track Census form submissions and response rates.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h2>Census Type of Enumeration Area Viewer (TEA)</a></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The Census <em>Type of Enumeration Area Viewer (TEA)</em> shows census tracts that will receive census forms through the "Update/Leave" and "Update/Enumerate" programs. 
These programs are designed to serve rural areas with homes that do not have standard street addresses. The census bureau estimates that five percent of  homes nationwide 
will be enumerated using these programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Homes that are part of the "Update/Leave" program will be visited by a census enumerator, who will leave a census form behind for the household to complete.</li>
<li>Homes that are part of the "Update/Enumerate" program will be visited by an enumerator, who will complete the census form during their visit with a household.  
The "Update/Enumerate" program is focused on remote areas in Alaska and Northern Maine.</li>
</ul>

<button class="accordion"><h2>Census Mail Contact Strategies Viewer</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The Census <em>Mail Contact Strategies Viewer</em> shows how the country will be asked to respond to the 2020 Census. 
Nearly every household will be invited to respond online, by phone or by mail to the census starting in mid-March 2020. 
Most areas, about three of every four households, will receive an invitation to respond online (or by phone), while the other households will receive a 
paper questionnaire along with an invitation to respond online. Regardless of which invitation they receive, all households that have not yet responded will receive a 
paper questionnaire by mid-April. This map also shows which households will receive English/Spanish bilingual invitations and questionnaires.</p>

<p>The interactive map illustrates the contact strategy to inform the public and partners of the Census Bureau’s plan to count everyone by geographic location for the 2020 Census. 
A decade of research and testing has determined the best way to invite everyone to respond to the 2020 Census.
Most households will first receive a letter asking them to complete the census questionnaire online with information about how to respond online or by phone in 
English plus 12 non-English languages. Areas less likely to respond online, approximately 21.8% of households, will receive a paper questionnaire along with the invitation to 
respond online or over the phone. Areas assigned to receive a paper questionnaire first have a low self-response rate to the Census Bureau’s ongoing American Community Survey (ACS), 
and have either low internet response rates, high population over age 65, or low rate of internet subscriptions.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h2>Census Planning Database</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The <em>Census Planning Database (PDB)</em> assembles a range of housing, demographic, socioeconomic, and census operational data that can be used for survey and census planning. 
Data are provided at both the census block group and tract levels of geography.  It includes the Census <em>Low Response Score (LRS)</em> used to identify tracts with a high percentage 
of "hard to count" populations.</p>
