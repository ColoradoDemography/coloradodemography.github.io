## Colorado 2020 Census Support Program  Page

### This program is currently closed and not accepting applications.  SDO is processing the applications received as of January 15, 2020.  The program may re-open if additional funds are available.
 
The Colorado 2020 Census Support Program (CCSP) was created to support the outreach efforts of local governments, non-profit organizations and partner organizations (“local organizations”) by providing promotional materials to improve self-response rates to Census 2020.  This program is specifically designed for local organizations who are actively coordinating their outreach efforts with a Local or State Complete Count Committee/Campaign.  If the community does not have a Complete Count Committee, contact the State Demography Office for options. The funds are to be used to support or supplement Census 2020 education and outreach activities.

This Program has approximately $220,000 available and is limiting requests to $2,500 per organization.  Each item may be less than $2,500 but total requests over the time period may not be more than $2,500.  If requests have not fully exhausted the $220,000 by January 30th 2020, additional funds may be available to organizations who have already met the limit of $2,500. 

If you have any questions about this program, please contact Adam Bickford at [adam.bickford@state.co.us](maito:adam.bickford@state.co.us) or Justine May at [justine.may@state.co.us](mailto:justine.may@state.co.us)

### Census Posters Developed by the State Demography Office
Census posters are a great way to raise awareness about the Census and its importance.  The State Demography Office has developed a library of posters you can download and print locally.  These posters can also be printed by IDS or your local printer.  The cost of printing is eligible for CCSP reimbursement.
Posters can be customized by adding your logo or modifying the message.  Please contact Justine May at [justine.may@state.co.us](mailto:justine.may@state.co.us) for more information.
