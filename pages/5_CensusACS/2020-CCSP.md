 ### Program Description
 
 The Colorado 2020 Census Support Program (CCSP) was created to support the outreach efforts of local governments and partner organizations by providing promotional materials to better reach hard-to-count 
populations and improve self-response rates to Census 2020.  This Program is specifically designed for local governments and partner organizations who are actively involved providing education and outreach for Census 2020 and are involved with a Complete Count Committee/Campaign.  The funds are to be used to support or supplement existing outreach activities in hard-to-count communities.  

This Program has approximately $220,000 available and is limiting requests to $2,500 per organization.  Each item may be less than $2,500 but total request over the time period may not be more than $2,500.  If requests have not fully exhausted the $220,000 by January 30th 2020, additional funds may be available to organizations who have already met the limit of $2,500. 

 
 ### Payment Arrangements
 The CSSP will 
 1. Reimburse local governments or partner organizations  through an electronic funds transfer (EFT) or warrant based on a paid receipt submitted per Guidelines to be reimbursed for approved purchases made by the local government,
 2. The vendor will send DOLA/SDO an invoice for payment, or
 3. DOLA/SDO will directly order material through the state printer or other vendor.
