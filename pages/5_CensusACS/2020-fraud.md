 ## 2020 Census Fraud Detection and Census Scams
 
 Last Update:  10/19/2019
 
 
 The 2020 Census is the largest single non-defense activity conducted by the Federal Government. 
 The Census Bureau provides resources and information to identify legitimate census data collection efforts and avoid census scams.  
 The links below highlight ways to identify census scams and to protect your personal information 
 
 ### Avoiding Phising Scams Online
 Phishing is a criminal act in which someone tries to get your information by pretending to be an entity that you trust. 
 Phishing emails often direct you to a website that looks real but is fake—and may be infected with malware.

It is important to know that the Census Bureau will not send unsolicited emails to request your participation in the 2020 Census. 
Further, during the 2020 Census, the Census Bureau will never ask for:

 - Your Social Security number.
 - Your bank account or credit card numbers.
 - Money or donations.
 
In addition, the Census Bureau will not contact you on behalf of a political party.

 ### How Can You Verify That Someone Is a Census Worker?
  
 If you are visited by someone from the Census Bureau, here are some ways to verify the individual is a Census Bureau employee:

The field representative will present an ID badge that includes:
 - their name,
 - their photograph,
 - a Department of Commerce watermark, and
 - an expiration date.
 
A field representative will be carrying an official bag with the Census Bureau logo or a laptop for conducting the survey.

The field representative will provide you with a letter from the Census Bureau on official letterhead stating why they are visiting your residence.
Field representatives conduct their work between the hours of 9am and 9pm, local time.
Upon request, the field representative will provide you with their supervisor’s contact information and/or the phone number for your Census Bureau Regional Office. 
The Regional Office supervises the activities of all field representatives in your area.

 ### How the Census Bureau Protects Your Data
The U.S. Census Bureau is bound by law to protect your answers and keep them strictly confidential. 
In fact, every employee takes an oath to protect your personal information for life.
