## How to respond to the Census

There are multiple ways to respond to the Census.  For most people, the census response process will begin with a Census Postcard send to an address.
The Postcard will give the recipient multiple options to respond:

* Online, using a web browser,
* Online, using a smart phone,
* Over the telephone, by calling the Census Questionnaire Assistance Center, or 
* By requesting a paper form from the Census Questionnaire Assistance Center.

Online forms, paper forms and telephone scripts will be available in multiple languages.

After several days, addresses that have not responded to the Census will receive a second packet, called the “2020 Census Internet Choice Questionnaire Package”, containing a paper Census form, along with options to submit the form online or over the telephone.
After Census Day, April 15, 2020, Census Enumerators will begin canvassing addresses that have not responded to previous mailings.
There are special counting procedures in place to count college students, people in Institutions, the homeless, and the incarcerated.
